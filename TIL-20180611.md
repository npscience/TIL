Git in the command line

* In an already cloned repo, SSH already set up.

1. cd to directory
2. touch to create file
3. atom file to edit file and save
4. git init to initialise repo
5. git pull to check working on most current version (should probably do this before 1-3 if concerned not up-to-date?)
6. git status --> shows untracked files
7. git add [directory or filename] --> tracks that file as something to be committed to remote repo
8. git status - check new file or directory is now untracked
9. git commit -m "commit message" to commit files
10. git remote -v to check with branch you're on and how push/pull is set up
11. git push to push commits to master

So that's

1. git init
2. git pull
3. git remote -v (check)
4. git status (check)
5. git add [filename]
6. git status (check)
7. git commit -m "message"
8. git push
