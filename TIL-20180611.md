Git in the command line

* In an already cloned repo, SSH already set up.

1. cd to directory
2. touch to create file
3. atom file to edit file and save
4. git init to initialise repo
5. git pull to check working on most current version (should probably do this before 1-3 if concerned not up-to-date?)
6. git status --> shows untracked files
7. git add [directory or filename] --> tracks that file as something to be committed to remote repo
8. git status - check new file or directory is now untracked
9. git commit -m "commit message" to commit files
10. git remote -v to check with branch you're on and how push/pull is set up
11. git push to push commits to master

Note git pull won't work if you haven't specified the remote and method (HTTPS or SSH). To do this:
git remote add origin [clone detail e.g. git@github.com:npscience/directory.git for SSH]

Then specify branch:
* git checkout master
* git branch (to check it say's master)
* git branch [new-branch-name]
* git checkout [new-branch-name]
git pull [remote] [local] == git pull origin master
* git merge [new-branch-name] master (to check local branches are up-to-date)
if they are then, delete the user branch:
* git branch -d [new-branch-name]
* git checkout master (switch back to master)


1. git init
2. git pull
3. git remote -v (check)
4. git status (check)
5. git add [filename] (or git add --all to add all new)
6. git status (check)
7. git commit -m "message"
8. git push
9. git status (to check all up to date)
