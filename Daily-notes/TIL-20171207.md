## How to add basic metadata to a markdown file

Copying from Yo Yehudi (@yochannah) e.g. in https://github.com/yochannah/code-is-science/blob/master/content/posts/mozfest-session-2017.md

Add this to the top of .md files:

---
title: "title"
author: yourname
date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmZ
---

This doesn't show in the rendered document but is searchable metadata.

I found a little more about this good habit at https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/18/markdown-metadata/.

## How to add a table of contents (TOC) to a markdown file

Package: markdown-toc
Source: https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc

```
npm install --global markdown-toc
```
Note: The base instructions in the README advise you install using --save but this does not put this in a path that is in PATH. So use --global to ensure it gets added to PATH properly so you can use this anywhere in your directory. See [issue 98](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc/issues/98).

Navigate to the directory containing the .md you wish to add a TOC to.
In the .md add <!-- toc --> in the location where you wish the TOC to be, save.

```
markdown-toc -i filename.md
```

-i adds the TOC directly to the .md at the site indicated by <!-- toc -->.

More CLI usage options on the GitHub page.

> Note: I tried to add a maxdepth but it didn't work. Without maxdepth, my TOC included instances throughout the text where I had used *italics* and/or sections
