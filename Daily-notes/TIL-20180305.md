## Refining python for data analysis

Thanks to @RaoOfPhysic's suggestions, I improved the python from the bike theft notebooks

[Improved]()

Changes made:
* Import data from URL. Can do it simply with pandas; no need to use the Urllib:

```
data = pd.read_csv('bikethefts.csv')
```

and to add the GitHub URL, click raw on the file and use that URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-data-day-cambridge-2018/bicycle-theft-cambridgeshire/master/data/processed/bikethefts.csv

```
data = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-data-day-cambridge-2018/bicycle-theft-cambridgeshire/master/data/processed/bikethefts.csv')
```

So to start us off to retrieve the data:
```
import csv
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv('THATLONGRAWURL.csv')

list(data) # This will give you the header for your data frame
```

* To use pandas to find the number of rows:

```
 total = len(df.index)
 print(total)
 ```

* Add line between paragraph and bullet text in markdown to get the right formatting!

* before you push your notebook to GitHub, click on "Kernel" and then "Restart & Run All". So that your code chunks have the correct sequential numbers from 1 to whatever.

* To make notebooks interactive, make sure your repo contains the requirements.txt otherwise the dockerfile doesn't know the dependencies to install.

* Also, for any project, if anyone's using macOS, make sure that ".DS_store" is added to the .gitignore. Otherwise the world can see their directory state.
