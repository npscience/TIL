Gah, that pesky .DS_Store is stopping me from `git pull`ing into my local TIL repo. [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14744993/git-strange-branch-merge-error-that-i-am-not-sure-how-to-solve) has a solution: remove .DS_Store locally. It's hidden in my directory tree, but `rm .DS_Store` in the right directory does the job. :detective:

Note: .DS_Store is already in my .gitignore so who knows why it's not ignoring it...
